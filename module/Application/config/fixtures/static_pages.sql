The webcammer''s internet connection is therefore a determining factor for the quality of the video.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-left: 60px;">The best thing to do in these cases is to report this to the webcammer. He/she can then try to correct the images or he/she will contact us to have a better image for your next private chat.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="list-style-type: none;">\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>3.3 My webcam isn''t working</h3>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="margin-left: 60px;">Check whether your webcam is working in another application such as Skype or MSN.Click in the field where your webcam image should be with the right mouse button in the chat application. Choose settings / webcam icon and choose your webcam.Verify that no other program is using your webcam at the same timeIf the above mentioned steps don''t help, it''s best to reinstall your webcam''s driver software. This can always be found on the website of your webcam''s manufacturer.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="list-style-type: none;">\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>3.4 My browser crashes all the time</h3>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="margin-left: 60px;">Your Adobe Flash player instalment is probably corrupt. You can solve this by reinstalling it.<br />You first need to remove the current version from your computer.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-left: 60px;">To uninstall Adobe Flash Player, you need to follow Adobe''s instructions. These can be found here. You will need to download some things from the Adobe site.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-left: 60px;">Once the old version has been removed, you can install the new version, by taking the following steps:Follow the instructions on the Adobe siteOnce the have downloaded the latest version, close your browserInstall the update. You should then be able to see our webcams without any problems.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-left: 60px;">For Windows VISTA users:<br />If the problem persists after reinstalling Flash, it could be caused by aMicrosoft Windows Vista permission problem.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-left: 60px;">Click on the Windows button and then the search function:<br />go to: C:\\Windows\\System32\\Macromed\\Flash\\right mouse click on the file: FlashUtil9b.exe or FlashUtil9e.exechoose ''Execute as Administrator'' and install the updateRestart your computer.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="list-style-type: none;">\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>3.5 Loading preferences failed ... Probably firewall issue (port 1935). What do I need to do?</h3>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="margin-left: 60px;">The live webcam chat platform uses various ''ports'' of your internet connection.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-left: 60px;">When these ports are blocked, you will not be able to make a connection with the webcammer. You can try to switch off your personal firewall (often a part of your anti-virus program). If you can then make a connection with our platform, then try to switch the firewall on again and explictly enable port 1935 and port 80 only.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-left: 60px;">Also check whether port 2037 and 1935 aren''t blocked by your operating system:<br />http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308127 (for PC)<br />http://homepage.mac.com/car1son/static_port_fwd_firewall.html (for MAC)</p>\r\n<p style="margin-left: 60px;">When you have switched off your firewall and it still doesn''t work, you can check whether you are using a ''router'' on your network. Firewalls could be configured on some routers that can block ports 1935 and 80. Check whether this is the case.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-left: 60px;">If the above mentioned tips still don''t help, contact our live support.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="list-style-type: none;">\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>3.6 The webcammer can''t hear me. What can I do?</h3>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="margin-left: 60px;">You can only talk with a webcammer while you are in a private session and your webcam has been switched on.<br />Your microphone is normally activated automatically. If you have connected several microphones (for example one in-built in the PC and one built into the webcam), you have to first determine (only once) within the application which microphone you want to use.<br />Right click in the chat window.You then get a menu, where you click on the option "Settings..."Your main screen becomes grey; you get the "Macromedia Flash Player Settings" menu (See below)Click below on the tab with the microphone, choose the microphone you want to activate in the drop-down list. Set the volume and check if "Reduce echo" is on.Click "close" to store and save your settings.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="list-style-type: none;">\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>3.7 I have problems accessing the video chat via my iPad</h3>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="margin-left: 60px;">To have good access to our live webcams and chat it''s important that your device has a stable internet connection.<br />More information and a solution for the issue can be found on the support site of Apple via this link :<br />http://support.apple.com/kb/TS3237?viewlocale=en_US</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2><a href="#">4 Private chat</a></h2>\r\n<div>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="list-style-type: none;">\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>4.1 What is private chat?</h3>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="margin-left: 60px;">Thanks to our private functionality you can get the webcammer entirely dedicated to you. As soon as you start the private session the other visitors will not be able to chat with the webcammer. On top of that you''ll be able to speak to the webcammer instead of typing.</p>\r\n<p style="margin-left: 60px;">Some things you need to know about private sessions:<br />the webcammer decides if he/she offers private chat and at what price. The price is displayed in the button.private chat is only available for visitors with an account. Customers paying by telephone will not be able to use this service.when you start a private session, the webcammer will need to accept first. Sometimes it''s a good idea to ask the webcammer if he/she is prepared to offer you a special private show.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="list-style-type: none;">\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>4.2 Why I don''t see a private button?</h3>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="margin-left: 60px;">There can be several reasons:<br />The webcammer does not offer this functionality. Every webcammer can decide if they offer it or not. Request the webcammer to activate it.You are using your telephone to access our website. The private functionality is only available for visitors with an account. You can create an account in just a few seconds. Afterwards you can enjoy this function as well. The webcammer is already in an active private chat with another visitor. You can continue to watch the show until you wait for the current private session to end.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style="list-style-type: none;">\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>4.3 I can''t chat with the webcammer. Why?</h3>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style="margin-left: 60px;">When a webcammer is in an active private session or starts a new one with another visitor, you will no longer be able to chat with him/her. You can of course continue to watch the live show.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<h2><a href="#">5 Contact Customer Service</a></h2>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>', 0, 1, NULL, ''),

Keep in mind where your lights are relative to your camera. If a bright light is behind you chatters may not be able to see your face. Soft, warm lighting is best. Keeping a lamp behind the camera helps the chatter see your face and highlight your attributes. Another thing to keep in mind is how bright a light is on your ceiling as well.

Think about what you would wear around the house to relax in. A simple outfit that your boyfriend would like is something chatters would like. It makes the experience in your chat more realistic. Some examples are cotton shorts and a tank top, panties and knee high socks with a tank top or even something like a baggy t-shirt and panties that you can pull and play with in free. If your chatters say your outfit is too much then you can tease them by pulling it tight across your body or showing a little skin. It''s nice to leave a little to the imagination.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Costumes</p>\r\n<div class="content">\r\n<p>Having costumes are much like having outfits to try on in your room.

So remember to be versatile and creative with props and toys. Don''t ever use something as a toy if it''s not supposed to be used that way because it can be harmful and painful.

They are paying more for your undivided attention so give it to them. Some models reserve certain things for exclusive only. This is not recommended. Models who don''t reserve anything still get exclusives. What you really want are group chats because many people can watch you at the same time. You make more money in group than in exclusives.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Take it slow and do what they want</p>\r\n<div class="content">\r\n<p>Read your customers. A lot of chatters use exclusive to get to know a cam model better. It''s okay to jump right in but if they want to talk don''t be afraid to. It''s a much more intimate setting for the chatter so have fun with it. Occasionally you will get "talkers" they are chatters who don''t want anything sexual. Typically these chatters won''t do a show with you if you don''t have a welcoming personality. So what they do is take you exclusive to see how you act one on one. Be yourself and be happy that they are there talking to you.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Use their names</p>\r\n<div class="content">\r\n<p>Use their name or nick name, make a nick name for the time being just to be more personal. To make your chatter feel more comfortable and involved in the show you should always use their name. Sometimes they tell you their real first name so you can say it for them. It''s fun for the chatter and more realistic.</p>\r\n<p>Extras are a plus</p>\r\n<div class="content">\r\n<p>The more you are willing to do the higher diversity you will have in chatters.

I do not recommend saying I love you to a chatter. Some people out there are very lonely and may take you seriously. The last thing you want is a chatter who won''t leave you alone in public chat or flooding your inbox. It''s easy to block them, but think twice if they are a good paying customer. It''s up to you and how comfortable you feel with that person around.</p>\r\n<p>Getting gifts</p>\r\n<div class="content">\r\n<p>This part is a lot of fun it''s really cool to have chatters send you gifts. But keep in mind that the more gifts they send you the less time they spend in chat. So if your goal is to make as much money as possible then try to keep gifts out of the conversation. If a chatter asks you in a pm if you want a new toy or outfit and you need it then go for it. But if the conversation arises in public chat you could end up with a lot of gifts and not as many privates.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to read customers</p>\r\n<div class="content">\r\n<p>Reading customers is very important but it''s hard because you can''t hear tone in written words. Sarcasm is hard to read unless they use an emoticon. Chatter''s have feelings too, don''t make them feel ashamed of their sexual preferences.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Be very sensitive</p>\r\n<div class="content">\r\n<p>Surprisingly a lot of chatters will come to a cam model and want to talk AND see a show. Sometimes their lives are really hard and they just want to vent. Listen to them and don''t hurt their feelings if they share something really intimate. It''s better to stay out of their lives but if someone is going to spill their emotions it''s best just to listen and try to be sincere.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Pics &amp; Videos</p>\r\n<div class="content">\r\n<p>A really great aspect of cam modeling is making money when you aren''t online. If you have a lot of pictures on your profile it will motivate the chatter to come back to your room when you are scheduled next. You really should make videos for your profile too.

New ones crop up all the time too. The main fetishes include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Foot fetish</li>\r\n<li>Long hair</li>\r\n<li>Hair color</li>\r\n<li>Eyes</li>\r\n<li>Bondage and S&amp;M</li>\r\n<li>Watching someone have sex or masturbate is considered a fetish so if a chatter seems boring think about how arousing it is for them just to watch. You need to keep yourself interested too.</li>\r\n<li>Worship which branches from bondage. This can include a person or just body parts.</li>\r\n<li>Objectification - This is a big one because many people want to be dominant or Tops. Calling someone a Top means they are the dominant person in a sexual relationship. This may not mean they are dominant outside of the bedroom but it does mean they take control during sex. A Bottom is the submissive role in a sexual relationship. Objectification takes it a step further because it deals with using your sub as an object, like a footrest or a chair. Most Tops enjoy objectification because it has such a broad range of uses. This can also include a sex slave but if you aren''t into hardcore bondage it may not be something you want to do.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>There are many more fetishes but you should familiarize yourself with the popular ones. Try visiting other cam models chat rooms and seeing what chatters ask for. You don''t need to log in or anything, just observe</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Don''t be greedy once you are in group</p>\r\n<div class="content">\r\n<p>There is no need to tease as much as you did in free. In free you tease your chatters so they will take you into group or private chat. Since you are private try to deliver on what you were teasing. Some models will try and keep the chatter in the group or private session longer by not taking off their clothes for a few minutes. Chatters HATE it when models try to cheat them out of a show. If you get right into your show then your chatters will come back. It''s better to have many short private sessions with regulars then to have a few private sessions that last ten minutes. Plus, if you go into private with more than one chatter others will join in the beginning. If they see something they like they will stick around. But when a model tries to lengthen her private by just dancing or not taking off her clothes everyone will leave.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Multitasking in Group chat</p>\r\n<div class="content">\r\n<p>It''s really hard to please everybody so don''t try. Sometimes several chatters are watching you at once (which is great!) and they all want something different. Just take the requests in the order they came in and tell them that''s what you are doing. Chatters really like it if you address them like you would in a normal conversation.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When to say no</p>\r\n<div class="content">\r\n<p>If you ever feel uncomfortable with anything a chatter requests you can say no. It is your body and comfort level that you should pay attention to. Chatters will try and threaten you with leaving. It''s not worth it to put your self in pain or danger.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>How to say no</p>\r\n<div class="content">\r\n<p>Saying no is easy after the first time you say it. You don''t need to be rude even if a chatter is being a beggar or disrespectful. There are more regulars for a model if she respectfully declines a request. Making jokes about it can lighten the situation as well. Sometimes you will get a chatter who becomes offended. Basically you can''t please everyone, so don''t try to.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Role plays</p>\r\n<p>A very vital aspect of webcam modeling is role playing. Chatters come to cam models to escape and to have a different experience they may not get at home. Sometimes they are too afraid to try their favorite fantasy because it might be embarrassing or too bold. Keep this in mind; you never want to make a customer feel bad or embarrassed about their sexuality. It''s something we all have so let''s not make others feel bad about their most natural and carnal desires. That being said there are many roles to be played. Take a look at the list below:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Nurse and Patient</li>\r\n<li>ANYTHING incestuous, for some reason this is the most popular. It''s like what I said before, some of these fantasies from chatters are too bold or can''t actually happen in real life. It''s just fun on the internet.</li>\r\n<li>Schoolgirl and teacher</li>\r\n<li>Stripper (sometimes referred to as dancer) and customer</li>\r\n<li>Celebrity - This one is actually a lot of fun because your chatter is asking for something really specific. It''s easy to pretend to be someone else. If you aren''t sure ask them to link you to a certain video online in your inbox. Tell them you will check it later or when you take a break. Once you watch it and can say a few catch phrases the celebrity usually says then your set. If you fix your hair or do your make up like the celebrity does you have probably made yourself a regular. Not to mention the other chatters who will absolutely love that you put so much effort into just one chatter''s request.</li>\r\n<li>Cheerleader</li>\r\n<li>Spying on you while masturbating - Sometimes chatters will ask cam models to pretend they are not there and to only worry about their own pleasure.</li>\r\n<li>Some chatters pretend to be women so they can get a different perspective on a lesbian experience. Don''t call them out on it because it will ruin the fun.</li>\r\n<li>Adult baby - This fetish is a little bizarre to some because not many people have heard of it. Basically the chatter wants to act like a baby by wearing a large diaper or sucking on a pacifier. This may not be something everyone is comfortable with. That''s okay you don''t have to do anything you don''t want to. Just tell them it''s not something you are into and leave it at that. Other chatters notice how you handle awkward situations. If you answer gracefully and without insulting anyone you get more returning customers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class="content">\r\n<p>There are obviously a lot more but these are asked for often. If you want to educate yourself just do a search on the Internet. It doesn''t hurt to know about role playing before a chatter asks you to do one that''s obscure.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>', 0, 1, NULL, NULL);

Well, guess what, for every type of person, whether you are younger, older, skinny, plus size, gay, straight, male or female, there are going to be people who will pay you to model for them (the modeling agencies know this which is why they usually hire all types of models). Think about it, if every person only liked one type of look, then this would be one boring world full of robots who look and act the same. Come to think of it, the most successful webcam models I have met were actually not your stereotypical "model" types, but they were confident about who they were, and weren''t afraid to flaunt it! Love yourself and your body, no matter what you look like, and that self confident attitude will come across to your customers, making them worship you!</p>\r\n<p>dont be indenial</p>\r\n<p>Be true to yourself</p>\r\n<div class="content">\r\n<p>I am assuming that before you came to this site, you already knew that webcam modeling requires you to be nude and sometimes sexually explicit in front of strangers, although never in person. True, some customers may not be after a sexual experience, and just want someone to talk to, but that is a very small minority. With that being said, the first question you need to ask yourself is whether or not you''re comfortable doing what I just described, both mentally and physically? If your answer is, "no", then webcam modeling is definitely not for you! If you don''t enjoy what you are doing, the truth will eventually come out, and you will never be successful!</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span>Scheduling</span></p>\r\n<div class="content">\r\n<p>Chatters will most likely become recurring customers if you have a schedule posted, and can be relied on to follow that schedule.

As a matter of fact, I found that for webcam models personality matters much more than looks. If there is only one piece of advice I could give you, it would be, don''t take yourself too seriously! Have fun! Remember, people who want to chat with webcam models want an escape. They want to get away from their daily grind, and talk to someone who is fun, and uninhibited. If they ask you something crazy, don''t take it personal, laugh about it instead. If they feel that you are easy to talk to, and don''t have any hangups, they will stay longer and keep coming back. There are many different roles you can play, depending on what you are most comfortable with. You can be the dominate type who is slightly insulting, act shy, or play hard to get, but no matter what role you choose, play it well and be consistent!</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>', 0, 1, NULL, NULL),

What good is making all that money if you start getting stalkers finding you outside of work? Never ever use the internet without using a router. They can be relatively cheap and will prove more priceless than you know. Average time to hack into someone''s unsecured computer is 16 minutes. You read that right, 16 minutes. If you are connected directly to your modem then your internet, computer and most importantly your personal information are not secure. The router creates a barrier that hackers cannot get through, especially if you have a secured password for wireless. You may only have one computer and don''t think you need a router because no one else is using your internet connection. No one else may be using it but if you don''t get a router and make a password for your wireless internet through your router your computer is at risk for Trojans and viruses that can jeopardize your safety. If you aren''t sure how to do this contact your router customer service and tell them you want to secure your internet access with a password. If you contact your internet provider they can''t do anything to secure your router. You need to call the customer service for your router. You can find their number on the box the router came in or look on line.</p>\r\n<p>Also equally if not more important is never to give out your personal information such as your real name, address, phone number or email to customers you meet while working, unless you know deep in your heart you have met the person you are going to marry :) It''s really not a joking matter because you never know what the person you are chatting with is really like, and what they are capable of.

(26, 'general success manuel', 'general success manuel ', NULL, 'backend', '<p>Finding Webcam Jobs</p>\r\n<p>The website, network, or agency you work for makes a huge difference in your success or failure. Pick the right one, and you have a blast making more money than you ever thought was possible. Pick the wrong one, and you will waste tons of time without making money, and worse, you will feel discouraged with webcam modeling altogether. Your self confidence will suffer because you will assume it was all your fault, and you are not cut out to be a webcam model. You won''t even bother trying again, because everyone hates failure, especially more than once at doing the same thing!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>What Page You Will Appear On</p>\r\n<div class="content">\r\n<p>Even if you are on a very high traffic website, you may not see anyone in your room because you will be listed on a page noone sees. If you are not showcased on either page 1 or 2 under a popular category or the site''s home page, you might as well be on a site with no visitors, because that''s how you''ll feel. When looking for a webcam job, always ask how the site decides placement, and where you will be featured when you first start.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Working With An Agency</p>\r\n<div class="content">\r\n<p>There is a reason all successful Hollywood actors and actresses have agents. They have agents because they want to focus on doing what they know and do best, acting. They don''t have the time or desire to scout for auditions, negotiate pay and contracts, promote their image, do press releases, pick out potential scripts, discuss roles, projects, movies, etc.. They let their agents handle it all, why? Because that is what their agents know and do best, it''s their livelyhood. Agents have a direct incentive to find the best roles for their clients because the more money they get for their clients, the more money they will make for themselves, and the better their reputaion in the industry. If the agent does his/her job right, their clients will remain with them for their entire careers!</p>\r\n<p>Well, guess what, in the world of webcam modeling it works pretty much the same way. Webcam site owners work with modeling agencies to recruit models for their sites, and pay the agents directly for their services. The larger the agency, the more influence they have with the sites for model placement and hiring decisions. If you are a gorgeous, picture perfect model who is also a tough negotiator with sharp business skills and management contacts at top webcam sites, then you should not work with an agency, and try to apply directly with the largest sites you can find. You will most likely get hired, and join thousands of other hungry models in line to make a fortune in the business. Once you start working, if you don''t think you are making enough money or are not being promoted enough, tough luck! The site owners have no incentive to promote you because you''re on your own, and they are too busy making lots of money to care.</p>\r\n<p>Personally, I have always worked with an agency, and I have to say they were the key to my success from day one! I had a personal agent whom I could call on the phone day or night to ask for advice, report problems, or just share a few laughs about my day. Because of my agent, I was consistently showcased on the front page and the first page of my categories on the sites that I appeared on. I said sites because the agency I worked for,&nbsp;cam clients, represents many popular sites which get tons of traffic! Their system allowed me to work and be seen on thousands of websites at the same time. The amount of traffic, advice, and customers that I got by working with a top agency made it a no brainer for me, and I never looked back!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>traffic and quality</p>\r\n<p>Amount And Quality Of Traffic</p>\r\n<div class="content">\r\n<p>Perhaps the most important factor when deciding which website or network to work for is the amount of traffic they get. It''s not just the amount of traffic, but the type of trafic as well. Where is their traffic coming from? Are they just blindly buying text links on thousands of adult websites with low converting traffic, or is it a destination site itself with their own regular visitors and client base? Do they have U.S. traffic or if you are targeting another language or country, do they have your type of customers? These are the questions you need to ask, and don''t take their word for it, research it yourself. Look up the<a href="http://www.alexa.com/" target="_blank">Alexa</a>&nbsp;rating of the site(s) you are considering. Remember, any site with an Alexa rating of under 1,000,000 should not even be considered unless it''s a niche site like gay or shemale.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Pick a name that is easy to remember.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Upload pictures of yourself to all 6 spots, preferably ones that grab members&rsquo; attention.
